# jLeaflet
jLeaflet is a Java mapper for the JavaScript library Leaflet: http://leafletjs.com/

It allows you to easily create a Leaflet based map from within your Java applications. The maps can then be saved as file, displayed in an Java EE environment or whatever.

To make a senseful use of jLeaflet, you should be familar with the use of Leaflet itself. 

So far, jLeaflet reflects only some basic elements of Leaflet. Take a look at the class jleaflet.BasicTutorial.java: it recreates the map and its Leaflet objects mentioned in the original Leaflet basic start tutorial (http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html)

I build jLeaflet to use it in my own hobby projects. Anyboy else is invited to use, modify or extend it.
